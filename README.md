2-player turn-based game logic

Real-time input validation

🧠 OOP Concepts Used
Encapsulation – All game logic is managed within appropriate classes

Abstraction – Clear separation of user interface and logic components

Modularity – Separate classes/methods for checking win conditions, handling moves, etc.

Reusability – Game restart without restarting the application

Polymorphism and Event Handling – Used if GUI implementation includes ActionListeners
